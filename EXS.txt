1 .   Build Linear Regression for Salaries Data

Step 1: Importing the dataset
Step 2: Data pre-processing
Step 3: Splitting the test and train sets
Step 4: Fitting the linear regression model to the training set
Step 5: Predicting test results
Step 6: Visualizing the test results


2. Implement Same Procedure for Car Dataset

Enter Volkswagen cars Horse Power : 210
This Volkswagen Prce will be :  2146314 ?


3. Use multiple linear regression to predict the gas consumptions (in millions of gallons) in 48 US states based upon gas taxes (in cents), per capita income (dollars), paved highways (in miles) and the proportion of population that has a drivers license

4. Use Notebook file
